# Authentication Flow - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To provide a secure and user-friendly authentication system that enables users to register, login, and manage their account within the application.
- **Success Indicators**: High conversion rate of visitors to registered users, low authentication error rates, and positive user feedback on ease of use.
- **Experience Qualities**: Seamless, Secure, Trustworthy

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (users are actively inputting information and interacting with the system)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Users need a secure way to access personalized features of the application.
- **User Context**: Users will engage with authentication at the start of their journey and occasionally when their session expires.
- **Critical Path**: User arrives → Registers/Logs in → Accesses personalized dashboard and features
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. First-time registration with email validation
  2. Returning user login with proper credential validation
  3. Password recovery flow for forgotten credentials

## Essential Features
1. **User Registration**
   - What: Allow new users to create an account by providing email, password, and basic information
   - Why: Establish user identity and enable personalized experiences
   - Success: User can successfully create an account and receive confirmation

2. **User Login**
   - What: Authenticate returning users with their credentials
   - Why: Secure access to user-specific data and features
   - Success: Existing users can seamlessly access their account

3. **Password Reset**
   - What: Allow users to reset forgotten passwords
   - Why: Prevent account lockout and reduce support requests
   - Success: Users can recover account access without manual intervention

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Security, reliability, and professionalism
- **Design Personality**: Clean, modern, and trustworthy
- **Visual Metaphors**: Shield, lock, and key concepts for security elements
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface to reduce cognitive load during the authentication process

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent colors for actions
- **Primary Color**: The existing application's primary color for brand consistency
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral tones that complement the primary color
- **Accent Color**: Blue tones to represent trust and security
- **Color Psychology**: Blues and neutrals to convey security and professionalism
- **Color Accessibility**: All text and UI elements maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Follow the existing application's theme colors

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Continue using Inter for both headings and body text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between form labels, inputs, and helper text
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clear, and highly readable
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line height and spacing for form fields and instructions
- **Typography Consistency**: Maintain consistent sizing and weight across authentication forms
- **Which fonts**: Inter (already implemented in the application)
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at various sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Form fields and submission buttons are the primary focus
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between form elements to reduce visual clutter
- **Grid System**: Single-column layout for forms with clear separation between sections
- **Responsive Approach**: Forms adapt to screen sizes while maintaining readability
- **Content Density**: Low density with focus on one task at a time

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions between authentication states
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Form submission feedback and validation states
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animations focused on feedback rather than decoration

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for form containers, inputs with clear validation states, buttons with distinct states
- **Component Customization**: Utilize existing shadcn components with authentication-specific states
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for form validation, loading states, and success/error conditions
- **Icon Selection**: Lock, user, email, and status icons from Phosphor icon set
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary action buttons stand out visually from secondary actions
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding using the application's existing spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stack elements vertically with full-width inputs on smaller screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with shared authentication patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Form layouts, button states, and error messaging
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and alignment across all authentication interfaces
- **Brand Alignment**: Authentication forms reflect the overall application's visual identity

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Invalid email formats, weak passwords, account already exists
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages and recovery paths for all validation failures
- **Technical Constraints**: Simulating authentication in a client-side only environment

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Authentication system should be designed for future enhancements
- **Testing Focus**: Validation logic, error states, and user flow between authentication steps
- **Critical Questions**: How to securely store and manage authentication state in a client-side application?

## Reflection
- The authentication flow provides a balance between security and usability
- We've assumed users prioritize efficiency in the authentication process
- Exceptional implementation would include intelligent error prevention and seamless transitions
