# React Application Boilerplate PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To provide a modern, fully-featured React application boilerplate with industry-standard libraries for efficient development.
- **Success Indicators**: Easy setup, logical organization, comprehensive feature demonstration, and smooth developer experience.
- **Experience Qualities**: Robust, Scalable, Maintainable.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating (developers using this boilerplate as a starting point)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Developers need a solid foundation that already includes common libraries and patterns to accelerate new project setup.
- **User Context**: Developers will use this as a starting point for new React applications, referencing the implementation patterns for their own projects.
- **Critical Path**: Code exploration → Understanding implementation patterns → Extending for specific needs
- **Key Moments**: Form validation demonstration, Data fetching with Tanstack Query, Table rendering with Tanstack Table

## Essential Features
1. **Modern UI Components**
   - What: Integration of shadcn component library
   - Why: Provides accessible, customizable UI components
   - Success: Components properly themed and demonstrated

2. **Form Handling**
   - What: react-hook-form with resolver for validation
   - Why: Streamlined form state management and validation
   - Success: Working form with validation example

3. **State Management**
   - What: React Context API with useReducer pattern
   - Why: Centralized state management without external libraries
   - Success: Global state properly managed and demonstrated

4. **Data Fetching**
   - What: TanStack Query implementation
   - Why: Efficient data fetching with caching and state management
   - Success: API data fetching example that shows loading/error states

5. **Table Rendering**
   - What: TanStack Table implementation
   - Why: Advanced table features including sorting, filtering
   - Success: Working table with sample data

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, professionalism
- **Design Personality**: Modern, clean, and professional
- **Visual Metaphors**: Blueprint, foundation, structure
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced - clean interface with rich functionality demonstrations

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#0f172a) - communicates stability and professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Lighter blues (#1e293b, #334155) - supporting primary color
- **Accent Color**: Teal (#0d9488) - for CTAs and important elements
- **Color Psychology**: Blues instill trust and competence, teal adds creativity and clarity
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (#f8fafc) with Foreground (#0f172a) - High contrast for readability
  - Card (#ffffff) with Card-foreground (#0f172a) - Clean reading experience
  - Primary (#0f172a) with Primary-foreground (#ffffff) - Strong contrast for buttons
  - Secondary (#1e293b) with Secondary-foreground (#ffffff) - Good contrast for secondary elements
  - Accent (#0d9488) with Accent-foreground (#ffffff) - Distinctive for important elements
  - Muted (#f1f5f9) with Muted-foreground (#64748b) - Subtle for less important text

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Sans-serif for both headings and body for a clean, modern look
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size distinction between h1-h6 and body text
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line-height and max-width for text blocks
- **Typography Consistency**: Standardized font sizes and weights throughout
- **Which fonts**: Inter for both headings and body text
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at all sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Primary actions are emphasized with accent color
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing for clarity and focus
- **Grid System**: 12-column grid for layout flexibility
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with breakpoint adjustments
- **Content Density**: Moderate - balancing information with clarity

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations for state changes and transitions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary interactions receive more pronounced animations
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animations are functional and enhance usability

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for content grouping, Dialogs for modals, Forms for data entry
- **Component Customization**: Tailwind customizations for brand colors
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for hover, active, and disabled states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent visual language
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons use accent color, secondary buttons use lighter styling
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px-based spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layouts on mobile, side-by-side on larger screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with shadcn
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, component usage
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance for developer tools

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Complex form validation scenarios
- **Edge Case Handling**: Form error states, loading states, empty data states
- **Technical Constraints**: Client-side only (no server-side rendering as in true Next.js)

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Structure should support adding more complex features
- **Testing Focus**: Form validation, API integration
- **Critical Questions**: How to best demonstrate library capabilities within a simplified app

## Reflection
- This approach combines industry-standard libraries in a cohesive way that demonstrates best practices
- We've assumed developers need comprehensive examples rather than minimal implementations
- Making the boilerplate both educational and immediately useful would make it exceptional
